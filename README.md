# `HsYAML`: A Pure Haskell YAML 1.2 parsing and encoding library [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/HsYAML.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HsYAML) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haskell-hvr/HsYAML.svg?branch=0.2)](https://travis-ci.org/haskell-hvr/HsYAML)

## About  

* HsYAML is a [YAML 1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) parser and encoder implementation for Haskell.  
* It is in strict compliance with [YAML 1.2](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) grammer rules.
* HsYAML is tested using [YAML-Test-Suite](https://github.com/yaml/yaml-test-suite) and some other tests which can be found [here](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/tree/0.2/tests). 
* See HsYAML's performance on [YAML-Test-Matrix](https://matrix.yaml.io) which combines all tests from [YAML-Test-Suite](https://github.com/yaml/yaml-test-suite) and performance of all processors from [yaml-editor](https://github.com/yaml/yaml-editor).
* See what's changed in recent (and upcoming) releases [here](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/blob/0.2/ChangeLog.md).
